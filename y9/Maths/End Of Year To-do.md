Trig:
	==if in sin cos or tan how do you solve for x in the fraction ie if cos62=x/15 how do you rearrange to find x? - if x is on top, times. if x is on the bottom, divide==
	==in a right angle triangle use trig or Pythagoras?==
Algebra
	==solving formulas with x both sides==
	solving formulas with x in a fraction
	==simultaneous equations - same symbol (+ or -) = sub, alternate = add. must times so the x or y are the same in both equations==

Circle Theorems
	1. The radius and the tangent at the point of contact are perpendicular (meet at 90°).   
	2. The lengths of two tangents drawn from an external point to a circle are equal.
	3. The angle at the centre of the circle is twice the angle at the circumference subtended by the same arc.
	4. A right angle is subtended by a semicircle.
	5. Angles subtended by the same chord or arc, at the circumference, are equal.
	6. The Alternate Segment Theorem applies.
	7. The sum of the opposite angles of a cyclic quadrilateral is 180°.
