Trig:
	==if in sin cos or tan how do you solve for x in the fraction ie if cos62=x/15 how do you rearrange to find x? - if x is on top, times. if x is on the bottom, divide==
	==in a right angle triangle use trig or Pythagoras?==
Algebra
	==solving formulas with x both sides==
	solving formulas with x in a fraction
	==simultaneous equations - same symbol (+ or -) = sub, alternate = add. must times so the x or y are the same in both equations==
