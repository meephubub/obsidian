In _Macbeth_ Act 2, Scene 3, Shakespeare conveys Macbeth's distressed state of mind through his anxious and evasive speech following Duncan’s murder. When Macduff discovers the king’s body, Macbeth reacts with exaggerated horror, exclaiming, **"Had I but died an hour before this chance, / I had lived a blessed time"** (2.3.91-92). His words suggest a deep inner turmoil, as he paradoxically laments not only Duncan’s death but also his own loss of innocence. This dramatic statement serves as an attempt to feign grief while also revealing his regret, as he realizes he has doomed himself through his actions. Shakespeare’s use of irony here is striking—while Macbeth intends to appear loyal and shocked, his overly poetic response raises suspicion, hinting at the psychological burden he already bears.

Furthermore, Shakespeare highlights Macbeth’s instability through his impulsive decision to kill Duncan’s guards. When questioned about this rash act, Macbeth justifies it by saying, **"Who could refrain, / That had a heart to love, and in that heart / Courage to make’s love known?"** (2.3.116-118). His explanation appears rehearsed and excessive, as though he is trying too hard to prove his innocence. The juxtaposition between his calculated reasoning and his sudden violent action underscores his frantic state of mind—he is desperately trying to control the narrative but risks exposing himself in the process. Shakespeare thus portrays Macbeth as a man already unraveling, overwhelmed by fear, guilt, and the need to cover his tracks, foreshadowing his eventual descent into paranoia and tyranny.
