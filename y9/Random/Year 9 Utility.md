### Source A Analysis
Source A is useful for learning about life in Nazi Germany (1933-39) because it gives an insight into the instruments of terror used for oppression by the Nazi regime. For example, it says “everyone distrusted everyone else”, referring to the Gestapo (Nazi police) who played a key role in the persecution of political opponents or anyone that threatened Hitler and the Nazi party's power or undermined the war effort. I know this quote to be accurate as people from the Gestapo were in every work place, every street corner and every shop. People lived in fear as opposing the Nazi party faced heavy penalties and you would never know when a Gestapo member could be just around the corner.

This source further states that “I was nervous with the postman, the milkman, the newsboy”. People were intimidated by the SS who were given the ultimate power to arrest anyone and sent them to concentration camps without trial or proof which they often used to persecute those who again threatened the Nazi party or were not wanted or included within **Volksgemeinschaft** (only those who were Aryan were included) and I know from my own knowledge, the number of crimes punishable by death (prosecutable by the SS without proof) rose from 3 to 36 over the course of 6 years (1933-39), including listening to foreign radios and telling anti-Nazi jokes.

However, Source A is limited in some ways as it is written by a very outspoken critic of the Nazis and therefore might have an agenda. This being said, I know the source to be correct as ordinary citizens were encouraged to report on neighbours, co-workers, and even family members, with the Hitler's youth being set up to actively reward children tattling on their parents. Parents had no control over their children joining the Hitler Youth, as refusal to join could result in the children being taken away from their families, being seen as a political threat, making it a mandatory membership for their children.

Source A also fails to show what life was like for people accepted into the Nazi German society /syn
