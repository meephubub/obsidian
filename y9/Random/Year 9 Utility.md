### Source A Analysis

Source A is useful for learning about life in Nazi Germany (1933-1939) because it gives an insight into the instruments of terror used for oppression by the Nazi regime. For example, it says “everyone distrusted everyone else”, referring to the Gestapo (Nazi police) who played a key role in the persecution of political opponents or anyone that threatened Hitler and the Nazi party's power or undermined the war effort. I know this quote to be accurate as people from the Gestapo were in many places, and people lived in fear as opposing the Nazi party faced heavy penalties and you would never know when a Gestapo member could be just around the corner.

This source further states that “I was nervous with the postman, the milkman, the newsboy”. People were intimidated by the SS who were given the ultimate power to arrest anyone and sent them to concentration camps without trial or proof which they often used to persecute those who again threatened the Nazi party or were not wanted or included within **Volksgemeinschaft** (only those who were Aryan were included) and I know from my own knowledge, the number of crimes punishable by death (prosecutable by the SS without proof) increased significantly over the course of 6 years (1933-1939), including listening to foreign radios and telling anti-Nazi jokes.

However, Source A is limited in some ways as it is written by a very outspoken critic of the Nazis and therefore might have an agenda. This being said, I know the source to be correct as ordinary citizens were encouraged to report on neighbours, co-workers, and even family members, with the Hitler's youth being set up to actively reward children tattling on their parents. Parents had some influence over their children's participation in the Hitler Youth, but refusal to join could result in the children being taken away from their families, being seen as a political threat.

Source A also fails to show what life was like for people accepted into the Nazi German society as I know those included in Nazi society, those who accepted Nazi ideologies and those who were part of the Aryan race were treated relatively well. For example high ranking SS officers who were seen as being "pure" German enjoyed certain privileges, including better housing and education, with the Strength Through Joy program providing subsidized holidays and other benefits to certain groups of people, whilst those who didn't align with Nazi views were persecuted and oppressed.

In conclusion, Source A is quite useful for understanding life in Nazi Germany, particularly in understanding the atmosphere of fear and oppression created by the Nazi regime's use of terror. It offers valuable insight into how instruments like the Gestapo and SS were used to intimidate and control the population. However, its usefulness is somewhat limited by the one-sided perspective of an outspoken Nazi critic, which may introduce bias and overlooks the experiences of those who conformed to or benefited from the regime. Despite this, the source matches up with my knowledge of Nazi Germany, making Source A a reliable, though partial, account of life under Nazi rule between 1933 and 1939.
### Source B Analysis

Source B is useful for learning about life in Nazi Germany 1933-1939 because it shows an alternate view to one of oppression but instead of prosperity. For example it says "he has achieved a marvellous transformation" which I know, for those accepted into German life at least, is true as on paper, Hitler reduced unemployment significantly. He achieved this however by restricting access to employment for certain groups, including Jews, and promoting a traditional role for women.

Source B also suggests 'something of a great change,' which, from an outside perspective, would have appeared to be true, as the Nazi regime concealed its methods of terror and antisemitism from the rest of the world. I know this part of the source to be true because the Nazi regime deliberately used events like the 1936 Berlin Olympics to promote a positive image of Germany while temporarily downplaying its oppressive policies and antisemitism. 

Source B is also useful as it is a first hand account and I know it to be largely accurate, however it is limited in many ways. As it was written for a newspaper, it may have an agenda and may then be exaggerated. Mainly, it does not provide a broad perspective of German life as it was written by a British politician who did not live in Germany and it misses the perspective of those not included in volksgemeinschaft. 

Overall I think source B is only partially useful for learning about life in Nazi Germany because it only gives one perspective while life in Nazi Germany was very different for different people in different circumstances. Whilst it gives perspective to the outside observers of the successes of the Nazi regime, it fails to capture the experiences of persecuted groups such as Jews, political opponents, disabled individuals, and other marginalized communities. /sy
