summarise all the terrible things he has done. Define what a tyrant is  Contrast this with how he was presented in Act 1.

Early in the play, Macbeth is portrayed as brave, charismatic, and driven by ambition. He manipulates others into supporting his cause through fear and guilt-inducing language (e.g., "To fight," he cries). However, as he delves deeper into his desires for power and control, his character begins to break down. Trust in his own judgment is eroded when he decides to kill Macduff and falsely blames Duncan for his murder—moments that reveal his susceptibility to doubt and paranoia. This internal conflict and external downfall ultimately lead him to embrace a tyrannical lifestyle, where he justified violence as necessary for power.

By Act III, Shakespeare solidifies Macbeth's transformation into a tyrant. His willingness to sacrifice innocent lives for power is unacceptable to others like Lady Macbeth and Banquo, who witness his descent from moral integrity into tyranny. He becomes corrupt, turning his ambition into oppression rather than justice—and eventually his own downfall when his ambition spills over into murder (e.g., the chopping of Banquo's head). Despite his flaws, Macbeth remains a compelling character because he is human—the consequences of greed and unchecked ambition are as human as the desire for power itself.
