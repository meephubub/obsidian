**Explain why Hitler was appointed Chancellor in January 1933**

# Great Depression

One reason Hitler was appointed Chancellor in January of 1933 was due to the profound economic crisis triggered by the Wall Street Crash. After World War I, the US introduced the Dawes Plan in 1924 to help Germany pay war reparations, temporarily stabilizing its economy but making it reliant on American loans that were cut off after the US financial crash. This lead to mass unemployment, with 6 million Germans being unemployed by 1933, and social unrest allowing for an extremist party, like the Nazi Party, to gain support as they offered solutions to these problems, promising to "make Germany great again". Inflation made paper money useless, with a loaf of bread in 1933 costing 200,000 million marks as opposed to 250 in January 1923 before the economic crisis. This caused Germans to lose faith in traditional political parties, making them want change and moving to extremist parties such as the Nazi party. In 1928, before the financial crash, the Nazi party had 2.8% of the vote which rose to 18.3% a year after the crash in 1930. This caused him to be appointed chancellor as conservative politicians, such as Franz von Papen and President Paul von Hindenburg, believed they could control Hitler and use his popularity to stabilize the government. Compared to other factors, the economic crisis was arguably the most significant because it directly affected millions of Germans, making them more receptive to radical change, whereas other factors, like fear of communism and propaganda, built on this desperation rather than creating it.

# Fear Of Communism 

Another reason Hitler was appointed chancellor is the fear of communism. The largely growing communist party (16.9% of the vote in 1932) scared the middle class, especially business owners who would lose their businesses under communist rule. The Nazi party exploited this fear, portraying themselves as the only party strong enough to stop communism. Hitler used the SA to intimidate and suppress the Communists, often breaking up KPD meetings and violently confronting their supporters. This gave business owners a confidence that Hitler would squash communism, causing them to lobby Hindenburg to appoint Hitler to prevent a communist takeover. While fear of communism was a powerful motivator, it was less direct than the economic crisis in driving public support, as it primarily influenced the middle and upper classes rather than the entire German population.

# Propaganda

Another key reason for Hitler’s appointment as Chancellor was his use of propaganda. Every day, hundreds of thousands of Germans were exposed to Nazi messaging through the party’s 120 newspapers and Hitler’s speeches, which were widely broadcast on the radio. Nazi rallies played an equally crucial role, serving as one of the most powerful tools of the party’s propaganda machine. These massive gatherings reinforced Hitler’s image as a strong, charismatic leader, evoking emotions of unity and nationalism that helped him secure public support—ultimately leading to his appointment as Chancellor. The Nazi party also used strategic, targeted messaging in their posters, tailoring propaganda to specific demographics. For example, workers were promised "Arbeit und Brot" (work and bread), directly appealing to the working class. These posters were designed to be visually striking and easy to understand at a glance. Additionally, Nazi propaganda revived and weaponized the "stab-in-the-back" myth, fuelling public resentment against the Weimar government for signing the Treaty of Versailles, which many saw as a betrayal that crippled Germany. While propaganda was essential in making the Nazi party better known, it was only effective when combined with the existing economic hardship and fear of communism, which gave people a reason to believe in Nazi promises.

# Conclusion 

In conclusion, Hitler’s appointment as Chancellor in January 1933 was the result of many factors. The Great Depression was the most significant, as it created widespread desperation and, driving many Germans toward radical, far-wing solutions. Fear of communism further pushed the middle and upper classes to support Hitler to protect from the communist party. Meanwhile, Nazi propaganda built upon these fears, effectively winning over the majority of Germans. Ultimately, it was economic and political instability, and manipulation that allowed Hitler's rise to power.
